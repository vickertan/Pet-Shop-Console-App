# Description

  The "cage" in the program is just a variable name. We can actually place them according to the behavior of the pet. For example, we can put some dogs in a large and comfortable place so that they can play and move without any restrictions. We can also provide shelter for small pets such as hamsters, chinchillas and rabbits. We can take care of them in appropriately sized cages and allow them to play and live safely in the cage.
